// Trees are a classic data structure and they're also very commonly used.

// What is a Tree?

// a data structure that consists of nodes in parent / child relationship

// Lists => linear => it's one thing and then the next and next ... everything is in a line => we have just one line path
// Trees => nonLinear => they are branches => in trees we have different paths

// so you can think of a SinglyLinkedList as a special case of a tree

// when we talk about trees, there are some rules

// 1. A node can only point to a child, parent child relationship, we can't have a child pointing to the parent, we can't have a node pointing to sibling


// TREE Terminology

// . Root - The top node in a tree
// . Child - A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root
// . Parent - The converse notion of a child
// . Siblings - A group of nodes with the same parent
// . Leaf - A node with no children
// . Edge - The connection between one node and another

// Use Cases for Trees

// Lots of different applications!

// . HTML DOM
// . Network Routing
// . Abstract Syntax Trees
// . Artificial Intelligence
// . Folder in Operating Systems
// . Computer File Systems
// . JSON
